      This program I am to show you can calculate how much grams of CO2 you emit
      per day, and if that amount is good or bad. Here it is: Important: When
      downloading, ensure to unzip the folder. I know it's not ideal but
      Codesandbox doesn't allow .exe files. When you have unzipped the folder,
      launch the .exe file, and that's it. The main source code is in the .cpp
      file. Make sure that when you open the .exe file, go fullscreen, or either
      it will be very hard to read and interact with the program.
